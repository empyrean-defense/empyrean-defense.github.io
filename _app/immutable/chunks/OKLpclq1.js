# Flak Cannon\r
\r
The Flak Cannon is a heavy-duty anti-aircraft tower designed to take down flying units with explosive precision. It fires powerful shells that burst into shrapnel mid-air, dealing area damage to multiple enemies at once. Effective against clusters of fast-moving aircraft, the flak cannon is a vital defense tool for controlling the skies and keeping enemy air forces at bay. Its slower rate of fire is balanced by its ability to hit multiple targets within its blast radius, making it an essential part of any aerial defense strategy.\r
