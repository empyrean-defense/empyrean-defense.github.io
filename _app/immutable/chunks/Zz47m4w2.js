# UAV\r
\r
The UAV drone is a fast, agile aerial unit equipped with advanced surveillance and targeting systems. It swoops through the battlefield at high speed, scouting ahead to relay enemy positions and provide targeting data for incoming waves of enemy forces. While lightly armored, the UAV's speed and ability to evade most tower fire make it a challenging target for players, especially in higher waves where its reconnaissance can lead to more dangerous enemies arriving in force.\r
