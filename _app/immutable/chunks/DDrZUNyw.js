# Plasma Gun\r
\r
The plasma gun site is a formidable defensive unit, designed to control the battlefield with its powerful area-of-effect attacks. With a decent rate of fire, it rapidly unleashes high-energy plasma bolts that explode on impact, damaging all enemies within the blast radius. This makes it particularly effective against clusters of weaker foes, clearing waves with ease while providing consistent pressure on stronger enemies. Its ability to deal area damage ensures that no enemy can escape its devastating reach, making it an essential component of any well-rounded defense strategy.\r
