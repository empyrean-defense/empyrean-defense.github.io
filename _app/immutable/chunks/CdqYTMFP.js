\r
The Power Plant is a critical infrastructure site that generates and distributes energy to power your other installations. As the backbone of your operations, it ensures that military and economic sites function efficiently by maintaining a stable energy grid. Strategically placing and protecting your Power Plants is essential, as their destruction can leave vital towers and facilities offline, leaving your defenses vulnerable.\r
