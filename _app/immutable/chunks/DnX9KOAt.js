# Tesla Coil\r
\r
An automated Tesla coil turret is an advanced, unmanned defensive system designed to emit high-voltage electrical discharges to incapacitate or deter threats. Equipped with sensors and tracking systems, it can autonomously identify, target, and engage enemies or intruders with powerful electric arcs. Mounted on a rotatable base, the turret can direct its electrical discharges in multiple directions, providing a wide area of coverage. Commonly used in military or high-security environments, the Tesla coil turret offers a non-lethal yet effective means of neutralizing threats, leveraging the principles of high-voltage electricity for rapid response and area denial, while keeping operators at a safe distance.\r
