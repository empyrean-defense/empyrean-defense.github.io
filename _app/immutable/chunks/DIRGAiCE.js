# Flamethrower\r
\r
An automated flamethrower turret is an unmanned weapon system designed to project a controlled stream of fire to neutralize threats or deny access to specific areas. Equipped with sensors and cameras, it can detect, track, and engage targets autonomously or with minimal human oversight. The turret is mounted with a flamethrower, capable of delivering a sustained and directed burst of flame. Typically used in military, security, or hazardous environment applications, the system provides an effective means of area denial and threat suppression while minimizing risk to human operators through remote or automated control.\r
