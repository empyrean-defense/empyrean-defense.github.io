# Ion Cannon\r
\r
The Orbital Ion Cannon tower is a cutting-edge, satellite-linked weapon capable of delivering devastating energy strikes from space. It charges over time to unleash a powerful, targeted ion beam that deals massive damage to a wide area, making it ideal for eliminating clusters of enemies or high-value targets. While its long cooldown and high cost require strategic placement and usage, the destructive potential of the Orbital Ion Cannon is unmatched, offering a game-changing advantage in the heat of battle.\r
