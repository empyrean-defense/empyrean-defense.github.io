# Fighter Jet\r

The fighter jet is a cutting-edge, stealthy fighter jet renowned for its unmatched speed, agility, and advanced avionics. Equipped with powerful air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, it excels in rapid strikes and evasive maneuvers, making it a highly elusive and deadly adversary. Its stealth capabilities allow it to slip through radar defenses undetected, requiring players to deploy high-tech anti-aircraft towers to intercept it before it delivers devastating attacks.
