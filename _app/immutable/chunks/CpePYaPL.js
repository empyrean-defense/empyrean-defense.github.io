# Sniper Tower\r
\r
The sniper tower is a long-range precision structure designed to target and eliminate high-priority enemies from afar. Equipped with multiple high-caliber rifles with advanced optics, this site excels at taking out individual enemies with deadly accuracy. Its slow firing rate is balanced by its ability to deal significant damage with each shot, making it perfect for picking off lightly armored or fast-moving targets before they can breach your defenses. Positioned strategically, the sniper tower is a key component in any arsenal, providing essential coverage and control over the battlefield from a distance.\r
