# Pumpjack\r
\r
A pumpjack is a mechanical device used to extract oil from underground reservoirs. A pumpjack operates by using a counterweighted mechanism to repeatedly lift and lower a sucker rod into a well, bringing crude oil to the surface. Once the oil is extracted, it can be refined and sold, generating income. By strategically placing and managing pumpjacks on oil-rich plots of land, players can efficiently extract oil and convert it into valuable in-game currency, fueling further expansion and development in their oil empire.\r
