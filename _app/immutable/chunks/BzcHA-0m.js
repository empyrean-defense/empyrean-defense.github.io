# Raft\r
\r
The raft is a swift and agile vessel designed for rapid deployment across water-based terrain. Though lightly armored and vulnerable to enemy fire, its exceptional speed allows it to outmaneuver heavier, slower units. Equipped with basic weaponry, this unit excels in hit-and-run tactics, making it ideal for quick assaults or scouting missions where speed and mobility are key to survival. Its low defense means it relies heavily on evasion and surprise, striking hard and fast before retreating to safer waters.\r
