# Rotary Cannon\r
\r
An automated rotary cannon turret is a sophisticated, unmanned weapon system designed to detect, track, and engage targets autonomously or with minimal human intervention. Equipped with advanced sensors, cameras, and radar, it can identify potential threats in its designated area of operation. The turret is mounted with a machine gun, which is capable of rapid and sustained fire, and is often used in military and security applications to protect perimeters, facilities, and personnel. The system's automation allows for precise targeting and response times, enhancing defensive capabilities while reducing the risk to human operators.\r
