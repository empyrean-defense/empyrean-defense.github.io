# Submarine\r
\r
The submarine unit is a stealthy and tactical powerhouse, moving methodically through the depths with slower but deliberate speed. Its true strength lies in its ability to submerge beneath the water's surface, becoming temporarily invisible to enemy forces. This capability allows the submarine to evade detection, set up ambushes, or escape from dangerous situations. While it may lack the agility of faster units, its ability to go undetected for short periods makes it a formidable threat in strategic engagements, allowing it to strike from the shadows and disappear before the enemy can retaliate.\r
