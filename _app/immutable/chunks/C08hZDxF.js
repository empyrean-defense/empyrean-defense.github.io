The Field Tent serves as a rudimentary research hub, allowing players to unlock basic upgrades for their military towers. Despite its simple and temporary appearance, the Field Tent is a vital resource for early-stage advancements, offering players the opportunity to enhance tower capabilities and gain an edge in battle. Its minimal setup reflects its function as a stepping stone to more sophisticated research facilities, providing critical upgrades without the advanced technologies of higher-tier centers.\r
