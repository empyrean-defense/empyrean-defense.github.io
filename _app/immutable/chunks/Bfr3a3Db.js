# Rocket Post\r
\r
Featuring sandbag reinforcements and a camouflaged netting cover, the Rocket Post houses a dedicated rocket launcher system attached to a thick concrete slab. Designed for precision strikes, this site excels at engaging both ground and naval units with its armor piercing rockets. While it has a slower rate of fire, each shot delivers high impact damage with an increased critical strike chance, making it especially effective against tougher enemies. Its specialized munitions ensure reliable penetration of armored targets, providing essential firepower for strategic defense.\r
